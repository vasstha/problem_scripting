# Problem Solving with Scripting - Assignment 1

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the first assignment of the course *Problem Solving with Scripting*. The focus of the assignment is on solving problems using **classes** and **functions** in Python. The assignment includes two parts, each demonstrating the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and functional programming principles.

## Course: Problem Solving with Scripting
**Assignment 1** - Solving problems using classes and functions.

## Contents
1. **Part 1: Functions**
    - This part focuses on writing Python functions to solve specific problems. 
    - Key tasks involve defining reusable functions, handling inputs, and returning outputs in an efficient and optimized way.
  
2. **Part 2: Classes**
    - This part involves designing and implementing classes to model real-world scenarios.
    - You will use class inheritance, encapsulation, and other OOP principles to create a robust solution.

## Files
- `functions.py`: Contains all the function-based solutions.
- `classes.py`: Contains all the class-based solutions.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and the repository structure.
