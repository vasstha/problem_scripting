# Problem Solving with Scripting - Assignment 1

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the first assignment of the course *Problem Solving with Scripting*. The focus of the assignment is debugging the given snippet of a python functiona and to optimize the code. In the other part of this assignment, the aim is to use the class attribute of python programming to learn object oriented programming and to create object based on the classes.

## Course: Problem Solving with Scripting
**Assignment 1** - Solving problems using classes and functions.

## Contents
1. **Part 1: Debugging the given code and optimizing the code**
    - This part focuses on debugging the given Python functions and to find logical error and to optmizie the code. 
  
2. **Part 2: Classes**
    - This part involves designing and implementing classes to model a simple Banking System.
    - Here we have created subclasses and used the concept of inheritance to avoid the redundancy.

## Files
- `functions.py`: Contains all the function-based solutions.
- `BankAccount.py`, `CheckingAccount.py`, `main.py`, and `SavingsAccount.py`are the files to show the concept of Class, Subclass and Inheritance concept in Python.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and the repository structure.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/vasstha/problem_scripting.git)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Run the Python scripts:
   - For function-based solutions:
     ```bash
     python functions.py
     ```
   - For class-based solutions:
     ```bash
     python classes.py
     ```
